the basics of this powerful framework. Start by ensuring Flutter is installed and your development environment is set up with an editor like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Open a terminal and create a new project by running the command flutter create hello_world. Navigate to the project directory with cd hello_world, then locate the lib/main.dart file, which contains the main logic of the app. Replace its contents with a basic Flutter application, such as one using the MaterialApp widget to define the app and a Scaffold widget for the layout. Inside the Scaffold, use the AppBar widget for a title and a Center widget with a Text widget to display "Hello World" on the screen. Save the file and run the app on a connected device or emulator using flutter run. Within seconds, you'll see "Hello World" message displayed.
